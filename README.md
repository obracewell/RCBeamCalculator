        This website features interactive calculators designed to support reinforced concrete (RC) beam and column design and analysis. 
        It includes tools for three common RC beam types: singly reinforced beams (SRB), T-beams, and doubly reinforced beams (DRB). It also
        provides design calculators for square and circular RC columns. Reference tables commonly used in RC analysis and desgin are provided.

        For the beam analysis calculators, users can input design parameters and instantly visualize how those values affect beam strength. 
        The goal is to provide an intuitive way to understand structural behavior and the impact of design decisions.

        For the beam design calculators, users can input the known design parameters and design the reinforcing steel for their beam. 
        The goal is to show that multiple options will produce the desired strength and provide a starting point for exploring optimized designs.

        For the column design calculators, users can select parameters to determine the required cross-sectional concrete area and reinforcing 
        steel for square or circular columns. These tools guide the selection of bar arrangements that satisfy design requirements and allow 
        users to explore viable design options.
